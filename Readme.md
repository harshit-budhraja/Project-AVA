# Project AVA (Artificially Intelligent and Virtual Assistant) - The path towards creating an AI
##### Created and Tested on Linux with Python 2.7

An attempt to make a very simple AI bot that understands speech as well as text input and is capable of performing several tasks other than just conversing intelligently. The brain of this bot uses the ALICE's open source intelligence, with some of my improvements on it.

This project is based on AIML 1.0 and uses pyaiml for using the AIML interpreter in python. AIML, is based on pattern matching and this project does not implement any sort of machine learning or language processing.
Combined with a few python scripts, AVA is now on.

### Installation Notes

Do it by typing `python requirements.py` in the terminal.
